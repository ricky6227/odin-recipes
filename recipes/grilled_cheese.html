        <h3>Description: </h3>
        <p>
            If you're wondering how to make a grilled cheese sandwich, Jack's your guy. He makes one 
            so often that we have a dedicated grilled cheese pan in our kitchen. It's seen a million 
            grilled cheese experiments in its day-mayo on the bread, or softened butter? American 
            cheese or Swiss?-all of which have helped him work out what, in our opinion, is THE BEST 
            grilled cheese recipe. It's incredibly simple, but it yields an undeniably crave-able 
            sandwich. This grilled cheese is crisp and golden on the outside and deliciously melty in 
            the middle (see that cheese pull up there?!). Tomato soup for serving is optional, but 
            highly recommended.

        <h3>Ingredients: </h3>

                Dijon mustard

                Butter

        <h3>Steps: </h3>

                <strong>Start by making a homemade meat sauce.</strong> This is done by sautéing an onion 
                in olive oil until it begins to soften. This brings out the sweet flavor of the onion.  
                Then it is time to brown the ground beef until it is browned and the onion is softened. 
                Stir in the marinara sauce and let it simmer on low.  If you want your lasagna to be extra 
                saucy, I suggest adding 1/2 jar more marinara sauce.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Make a parmesan ricotta cheese mixture.</strong> This is what gives the lasagna the 
                creamy filling. I love to flavor the ricotta cheese with a good amount of parmesan cheese, 
                spices, and egg to bind it together.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Use your favorite lasagna noodles.</strong> There are two choices for lasagna 
                noodles — oven-ready pre-cooked noodles or lasagna noodles that need to be cooked before 
                hitting the oven. I have tried both ways and can attest that they both work!
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Bring on the cheese!</strong> The best lasagna is full of cheese so be generous with 
                the layers of mozzarella cheese.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Bake covered for 15 minutes.</strong> and then remove the foil and continue to 
                cook until the cheese is bubbly. Let it set up for 10 minutes before serving.
